Given the provided information about a patch including its patch summary, vulnerability type, vulnerability summary, and related code, your task is to recommend the most suitable direction for program slicing (forward, backward, or bidirectional) and the most appropriate code representation graph (Control Flow Graph, Data Dependency Graph, Control Dependency Graph, Program Dependence Graph, Abstract Syntax Tree, Code Property Graph) to use for each provided relevant statement. Your recommendations should aim to identify the precise code related to the vulnerability while preventing path explosion.
