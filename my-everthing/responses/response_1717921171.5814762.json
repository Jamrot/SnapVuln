The resume_name_len however\nis unsigned and for some infolevels is populated directly from a 32 bit\nvalue sent by the server.\n\nIf the server sends a very large value for this, then that value could\nlook negative when converted to a signed int. That would make that\nvalue pass the PATH_MAX check later in CIFSFindNext. The name_len would\nthen be used as a length value for a memcpy. It would then be treated\nas unsigned again, and the memcpy scribbles over a ton of memory.\n\nFix this by making the name_len an unsigned value in CIFSFindNext.\n\ndiff --git a/fs/cifs/cifssmb.c b/fs/cifs/cifssmb.c\nindex aac37d99a487..a80f7bd97b90 100644\n--- a/fs/cifs/cifssmb.c\n+++ b/fs/cifs/cifssmb.c\n@@ -4079,7 +4079,8 @@ int CIFSFindNext(const int xid, struct cifs_tcon *tcon,\n        T2_FNEXT_RSP_PARMS *parms;\n        char *response_data;\n        int rc = 0;\n-       int bytes_returned, name_len;\n+       int bytes_returned;\n+       unsigned int name_len;\n        __u16 params, byte_count;\n\n        cFYI(1, \"In FindNext\");\"\n}"
