  "patch_summary": "The patch fixes a potential memory leak in the nvmet-tcp module of the Linux kernel that could occur when tearing down a controller.",
  "vulnerability_type": "Memory Leak",
  "vulnerability_summary": "The vulnerability could cause a memory leak when commands fail before execution and are queued for sending a response, but the response never occurs because the queue socket is already down, leading to missed deallocation of command buffers.",
