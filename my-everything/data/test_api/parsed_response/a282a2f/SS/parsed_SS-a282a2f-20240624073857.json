Backward slicing is suitable as it helps trace back to the origins of the value in 'desc->fd_lens[0]', identifying all dependencies and conditions leading to this check. A Program Dependence Graph is ideal as it combines both control and data dependencies, providing a comprehensive view necessary for understanding the flow leading to this condition."

      "justification": "Similar to the previous statement, this condition checks for an excessive length that could trigger a buffer overrun. Backward slicing from this point allows us to identify how 'desc->fd_lens[1]' is computed and any control paths that influence its value.
