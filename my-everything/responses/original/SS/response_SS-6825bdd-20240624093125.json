Given the provided information about a patch including its patch summary, vulnerability type, vulnerability summary, and diff code, your task is to recommend the most suitable slicing direction (forward, backward, bidirectional) and the most appropriate code representation graph (Control Flow Graph, Data Dependency Graph, Control Dependency Graph, Call Graph, Program Dependence Graph, Abstract Syntax Tree, Code Property Graph) to use for each provided relevant statement. Your recommendations should aim to slice the precise code that could trigger the vulnerability, as well as code involved in causing the vulnerability, while preventing path explosion. Provide a brief justification for your choices based on each statement's role in the vulnerability.\n\nResponse format:\n{\n  \"statements_slicing_strategy\": [{\"statement_info\": \"[provided statement information]\",\"statement\": \"[code statement]\",\"slicing_direction\": \"[forward/backward/bidirectional]\",\"code_representation_graph\": \"[Control Flow Graph/Data Dependency Graph/Control Dependency Graph/Program Dependence Graph/Abstract Syntax Tree/Code Property Graph]\",\"justification\": \"[brief justification for your choices]\"}, ... ]\n}"
